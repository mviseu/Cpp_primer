C++ Primer

5th Edition

These are my proposed solutions to all the coding exercises from the Cpp Primer 5th Edition. I think it was a fun way to learn about C++ and modern practises: from all the basics of classes, iterative loops, sequential containers, to memory management, templates, inheritance.

Thankfully I took some tips from Moophy's github: https://github.com/Mooophy and also from jaege https://github.com/jaege/Cpp-Primer-5th-Exercises.
